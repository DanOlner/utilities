# Random useful bits and bobs

## UK Postcode gubbins

* The [postcodes_to_localauthorities](https://github.com/DanOlner/utilities/blob/master/postcodes_to_localauthorities_makelookup.R) script takes the latest codepoint open file of geocoded postcodes (you have to download that to the 'local' folder), collates it into a single CSV and attaches local authority names.
    - The output file itself is too big for github: that script has a [dropbox download link](https://github.com/DanOlner/utilities/blob/1169ffca8f0e7e9dbe89f3402b7fdcb398a7a145/postcodes_to_localauthorities_makelookup.R#L54); or [download here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/0873bsx2ka1d3clhs8e07/postcode_localauthority_lookup_2024-11-20.csv?rlkey=rtda1srm2nlzmqxc2ms6fllno&dl=1).
